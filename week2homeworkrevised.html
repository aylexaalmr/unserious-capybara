        <h1>My experience in College as a Sophomore Student</h1>
            <p style="font-size:120%; color:#5b66c2"> by <i>Aylexa Almanzar</i> </p>
            <p>If you ask me how has been my experience as a college student so far, I would say it has been both <i>challenging and rewarding.</i> 
            <br/> One of my biggest fears before starting college was not being able to make friends or meaningful connections. 
            I've always been shy and it has been difficult for me to put myself out there. However, I've been fortunte to meet wonderful people that 
            I connect with, share interests and support me. 
            <br/> If I have to be honest, last semester was the most challenging for me. It was the first time I took 5 classes and found myself being overwhelmed a couple of times. 
            The most challenging class was, specifically, Communication Design 1. We had multiple assignments every class (which we had to bring printed), 
            do lots of research and multiple exercises. 
            However, it felt really rewarding at the end because I got to create really beautiful pieces for my portfolio and did things I had never done before and didn't see myself capable of doing 
            (glad I proved myself that it wasn't that way!) What helped me to complete all my assignments was having the mentality that, eventually, <i>I'll figure things out and it's just a moment.</i> 
            <!-- tbh I'd take this class again. It was a meaningful class with insights of the industry and I believe any passionate designer would appreciate learning from this class! -->
            <br/> I also realized that when working on a project, the hardest step is actually the beginning of it. Coming up with new ideas and developing a concept
            is something that takes time but when once I come up with a strong idea, it feels amazing!
            <br/> I'm looking forward to the future semesters with a feeling of both anxiety and excitement. I know as I progress on my career, things will get more <q>difficult</q> 
            but I see them as part of my process in order to learn and become a professional. </p>

            <p> Respect is an ethical value that matters to me because when this is not present, then everything else crumbles. 
            It's the foundation in order to create connections and to keep them. <q> Respect is a two-way street, if you want to get it, you've got to give it. </q>
            <br/> On my free time, I like to play video games such as Mario Kart and Tomodachi Life and also I enjoy doing my makeup.
            <br/> My favorite food is <b> Pizza </b>. Pretty basic, I know, but it has been one of my comfort foods recently. <a href=https://unsplash.com/photos/pizza-with-green-leaves-and-red-sauce-XtLPfib7OuM> This is my favorite pizza flavor.</a> </p>
            <p> Finally, my favorite animal is capybara. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJDL1O8xrLc> Click here to watch top 5 capybara.</a> </p>
